## Game-of-Life
*Python Implementation of Conway's Game of Life*

The [Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life), also known simply as Life, is a cellular automaton devised by the British mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970.<br/>


&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;**Basic Rules**
- Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if caused by underpopulation
- Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation
- Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overpopulation
- Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction
